                A university (from Latin universitas 'a whole') is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which awards academic degrees in several academic disciplines. 
                Universities typically offer both undergraduate and postgraduate programs. In the United States, the designation is reserved for colleges that have a graduate school.
                The word university is derived from the Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium, which roughly means "community of teachers and scholars".
                The first universities in Europe were established by Catholic Church monks
